# Kerala-IoT-Challenge

> Foxlab Makerspace in association with GTech - Group of Technology Companies in Kerala is launching our prestigious program “Kerala IoT Challenge 2021”, with a vision to mould 100 IoT experts in Kerala, hosting on the µLearn platform. Kerala IoT Challenge is a program designed in 4 levels followed by a hackathon to identify and train quality industry leaders in the IoT domain, while any novice learner can start with layer 1 and others can enter laterally to the desired layer after an evaluation.
# About Me
> Hi everyone! I’m Thomas Jose, 2,nd year BCA student from St. Georges College Aruvithura ,Kottayam.I love in doing electronical and programming works together 
# Experiment 1 - Hello World LED Blinking

> A basic Program similar to printing "*Hello World* " in any programming language. The Aim is to blink an LED using **Arduino Uno Board**.

> Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board developed by Arduino.cc. It has several advantages over the conventional microcontrollers. It comes with a pre-tested software and hardware libraries and has its own integrated development environment (IDE). Also it is less expensive & beginner friendly.

## Components Required  
* Arduino Uno Board 
* USB Cable 
* LED (Any Color) x 1 Nos
* 220 OHM Resistor X 1 Nos
* Breadboard 
* Jumper Wires (Male to Male ) X 2 Nos

## Code

```

int ledPin = 10; // define digital pin 10.
void setup()
{
pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);// define pin with LED connected as output.
}
void loop()
{
digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // set the LED on.
delay(1000); // wait for a second.
digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); // set the LED off.
delay(1000); // wait for a second
}

```

## Output

> The LED is blinked with a time interval od 1 second

# Experiment 2 : Traffic Light

> In the previous program, we have done the LED blinking experiment with one LED. Now, it’s time to up the stakes and do a bit more complicated experiment-traffic lights. Actually, these two experiments are similar. While in this traffic lights experiment, we use 3 LEDs with different colors rather than 1 LED.

## Components Required 

* Arduino board *1
* USB cable *1
* Red M5 LED*1
* Yellow M5 LED*1
* Green M5 LED*1
* 220Ω resistor *3

## Code

```

int redled =10; // initialize digital pin 10.
int yellowled =7; // initialize digital pin 7.
int greenled =4; // initialize digital pin 4.
void setup()
{
pinMode(redled, OUTPUT);// set the pin with red LED as “output”
pinMode(yellowled, OUTPUT); // set the pin with yellow LED as “output”
pinMode(greenled, OUTPUT); // set the pin with green LED as “output”
}
void loop()
{
digitalWrite(greenled, HIGH);//// turn on green LED
delay(5000);// wait 5 seconds
digitalWrite(greenled, LOW); // turn off green LED
for(int i=0;i<3;i++)// blinks for 3 times
{
delay(500);// wait 0.5 second
digitalWrite(yellowled, HIGH);// turn on yellow LED
delay(500);// wait 0.5 second
digitalWrite(yellowled, LOW);// turn off yellow LED
} 
delay(500);// wait 0.5 second
digitalWrite(redled, HIGH);// turn on red LED
delay(5000);// wait 5 seconds
digitalWrite(redled, LOW);// turn off red LED
}

```

## Output

> In Traffic light the green LED blink about 5 second, then it is turnoff. Then the yellow LED blinks 3 times with a time interval of 0.5 second.Then the red LED blink about 5 seconds. This process continues.

# Experiment 3 : LED Chasing Effect

> We often see billboards composed of colorful LEDs. They are constantly changing to form various light effects. In this experiment, we compile a program to simulate LED chasing effect. The long lead of LED is the positive side; short lead is negative.

## Components Required

* Led *6
* Arduino board *1
* 220Ω resistor *6
* Breadboard *1
* USB cable*1
* Breadboard wire *13

## Code

```

int BASE = 2 ;  // the I/O pin for the first LED
int NUM = 6;   // number of LEDs
void setup()
{
   for (int i = BASE; i < BASE + NUM; i ++) 
   {
     pinMode(i, OUTPUT);   // set I/O pins as output
   }
}
void loop()
{
   for (int i = BASE; i < BASE + NUM; i ++) 
   {
     digitalWrite(i, LOW);    // set I/O pins as “low”, turn off LEDs one by one.
     delay(200);        // delay
   }
   for (int i = BASE; i < BASE + NUM; i ++) 
   {
     digitalWrite(i, HIGH);    // set I/O pins as “high”, turn on LEDs one by one
     delay(400);        // delay
   }  
}
